### 📁 Directory Descriptions

- **docker/**: Contains Docker configuration files.
- **src/**: Holds the source code, including components and styles.
- **public/**: Contains static files, such as HTML and images.
- **package.json**: Lists dependencies and scripts for the project.

## 🔧 Configuration

You can configure the application by modifying the `.env` file in the root directory. Here are some key settings:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for PostgreSQL.
- `API_PORT`: Port on which the Node.js server will run.

## 🎨 Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is integrated into this project for styling. You can customize the design by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file. Here’s how to add a new color:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        customColor: '#1c1c1e',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## 🧪 Testing

To ensure the application works as expected, you can run tests using Jest. Use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

### 🧑‍💻 Writing Tests

Create test files in the `__tests__` directory within `src/`. Here's an example of a simple test:

```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from '../App';

test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
